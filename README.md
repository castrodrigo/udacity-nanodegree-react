Udacity Nanodegree React

Repo for all exercises of the React Nanodegree program from Udacity

## Goals
For me, the main goal of doing this couse is to enhance my self-taught knowledge of React in a way that I understand more solidly the theoric part and deep concepts that could help to improve my ideas and think in better solutions to the many challenges that could appear :)
The methodoly used in Udacity is quite cool and different from other courses that I did before. I recommend it!
